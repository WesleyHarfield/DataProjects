Given that, it's more accurate to say that of the posts that received comments, ask posts received more comments on average and ask posts created between 15:00 and 16:00 received the most comments on average. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the top author's (whoishiring) posts, we note that by consistently posting about hiring related questions, this attracted a lot of comments, so talking about the recruitment process could lead to more activity on a post."
